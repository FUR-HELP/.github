# Help has no borders

FUR/HELP is an EU-based non-profit initiative by [@yukideer](https://github.com/YukiDeer) that benefits LGBTQIA+ asylum seekers and refugees from the post-soviet areas, as well as American transgender people in danger. Since November 2022, we have helped over 20 people to reach safety.

## ✨ What We Do

FUR/HELP is made by refugees for refugees, being refugee-centric we are:
- **Financially Supporting LGBTQIA+ Asylum Seekers & Refugees**: While we do so only partially for now, we help fund first necessities for LGBTQIA+ refugees & asylum seekers.
- **Developing Inclusive Resources & Services**: Developing resources, components, and solutions that prioritize inclusivity above all, seeking to build a great experience for all. From tools for refugees to better adapt to their new home to solutions that help in research for LGBTQIA+ rights. All with accessibility in mind.
- **Making Platforms for Cultural Exchange & Celebration**: Platforming cultures and dialogues that move forward the diverse world.

## 🚀 What we work on?

We’re currently involved in:
- [FUR/HELP Website](https://furhelp.lgbt): Our website that would host information that would be tailored to refugees as well as other people that face marginalization, highlighting issues not commonly talked about in mainstream activism. Website aims to be also WCAG compliant using [Accessible Astro Starter](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter) by [Incluud](https://incluud.dev/).

Planning to also work on:
- **LGBTQIA+ Safety Maps**: Maps with accessibility features that showcase accurate and detailed information on the state of LGBTQIA+ rights worldwide, with separate detailed version for each part of the huge LGBTQIA+ community from transgender people to two-spirit and beyond.
- **E2EE Encrypted Tools for Nonprofits**: We aim to make tools and services to empower other nonprofits with encryption, accessibility and inclusivity by default. From ticket tracking software to better track and streamline requests for humanitarian aid to management tools for safespaces to track and manage resources effectively and easier.

## 🌟 What we aim for?

> We fight for each of our refugees and make sure they get to a safe haven. We envision a future where no one must choose between authenticity and safety, as **help has no borders.**
